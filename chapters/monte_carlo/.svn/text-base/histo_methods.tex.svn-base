Histogram methods go back to \citet{salzburg}. To reduce the computational cost, one can compute a certain quantity at a given temperature and then extrapolate the result to other temperatures. This is only possible if the temperature dependence of the quantity is known. In the case of canonical variables the dependence is related to the Boltzmann factor. As a start, the partition function is reformulated in terms of possible energies instead of  possible configurations:
\begin{equation}
Q\kl{T} = \frac{1}{Z_T}\sum_E{Q\kl{E} p_T\kl{E}}\text{\hspace{0.2cm}with } Z_T=\sum_E{p_T\kl{E}}
\label{eq:part_fun_over_energy}
\end{equation}
where $p_T\kl{E} \equiv g\kl{E} e^{-\frac{E}{k_BT}}$ with $g\kl{E}$ being the \emph{density of states}. This is a factor that takes into account that more configurations could be possible at energies different than 0. The goal is to compute the quantity $Q$ at another temperature $T^*$:  $Q\kl{T^*} = \frac{1}{Z_T^*}\sum_E{Q\kl{E} p_T^*\kl{E}}$. The unknown in this equation is the density of states, which contains all the information needed. Using the definition of $g\kl{E}$ yields 
$$p_{T^*}\kl{E}=g\kl{E}e^{-\frac{E}{k_BT^*}} \underbrace{=}_{\text{def. of $g\kl{E}$}}  p_T\kl{E}exp\ekl{-\frac{E}{k_BT^*}+\frac{E}{k_BT}}
$$
and with $f_{T,T^*}\kl{E}\equiv exp\ekl{-\frac{E}{k_BT^*}+\frac{E}{k_BT}} $ one finally obtains
\begin{equation}
Q\kl{T^*} = \frac  { \sum_E {Q\kl{E} p_T\kl{E} f_{T,T^*}\kl{E} }}   {  \sum_E  p_T\kl{E} f_{T,T^*}\kl{E} }.
\label{eq:histo_average}
\end{equation}
We have now obtained an expression for the quantity $Q$ at the temperature $T^*$ without having to measure any distribution at temperature T, since the Boltzmann factor is a known scalar. The drawback of this method is that the values of $Q\kl{E}$ are sampled around the maximum of $p_T\kl{E}$, which  converges to a delta distribution for large systems. This means that if $T$ and $T^*$ are not very close, the statistics are very poor, and results will be inaccurate or  even wrong. One possible solution consists of interpolating data from several temperatures (multi-canonical method) but this involves calculations for many temperatures, which is also not efficient for large systems. Another solution to this problem has been presented in \citet{oliveira} and will be also treated in this chapter.
\subsection{Broad Histogram Method}
The aim of the broad histogram method is to directly calculate the density of states. It obtains the function $g(E)$ through a stochastic process. This function increases very steeply (exponentially) with energy $E$, since the number of possible configurations increases with higher energy. A plain random walk through phase space would also have the problem that it would explore only the regions with high energies. To explore all the regions equally (with respect to the energy) we can create a proper Markov chain in which the number of processes that increase the energy (we shall call this number $N_{up}$) and the number of processes that decrease the energy ($N_{down}$) fulfill an equivalent condition to detailed balance to reach a homogeneous steady state:

\begin{equation}
g\kl{E+\Delta E} N_{down}\kl{E+\Delta E} = g\kl{E} N_{up}\kl{E}.
\label{eq:detailed_balance_broad_histo}
\end{equation}
The motion (in phase space) towards higher energies can then be penalized with Metropolis-like dynamics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choose a new configuration
\item If the new energy is lower, accept the move
\item If the new energy is higher then accept with probability $\frac{N_{down}\kl{E+\Delta E}}{N_{up}\kl{E}}$
\end{itemize}
However, we haven't obtained the function $g\kl{E}$ yet. Therefore we will take the logarithm of Eq. \eqref{eq:detailed_balance_broad_histo} and divide by $\Delta E$


$$
\log \ekl{g\kl{E+\Delta E} } - \log \ekl{g\kl{E} } = - \log \ekl{N_{up}\kl{E} }  - \log \ekl{N_{down}\kl{E+\Delta E} } 
$$
\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow
\pder{\log \ekl{g\kl{E} } }{E} = \frac{1}{\Delta E}\log \ekl{\frac{N_{up}\kl{E}}{N_{down}\kl{E+\Delta E}} }  
\end{equation}
which we can numerically integrate to obtain $g\kl{E}$. Estimates of $N_{up}$ and $N_{down}$ can be obtained by checking if a change of state at each site would increase or decrease the energy.

While moving through phase space one can not only accumulate the values of $N_{up}$ and $N_{down}$, but also keep the values for the quantity $Q\kl{E}$. Finally one can compute
$$
Q\kl{T} = \frac  {\sum_E {Q\kl{E}g\kl{E}e^{-\frac{E}{k_BT}}}  }  {\sum_E {g\kl{E}e^{-\frac{E}{k_BT}}} }
$$
Knowing $g\kl{E}$ one can now calculate also other quantities after a measurements at a certain temperature.

\subsection{Flat Histogram Method}

This is another method, proposed by Wang, to obtain a flat distribution of visits vs. the energy. The basic algorithm works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with $g\kl{E}=1$ and set $f\equiv e$.
\item Make MC update with $p(E)=1/g(e)$.
\item If the attempt is successful at $E$: $g(E)=f\cdot g(E)$.
\item Obtain a histogram of the energies $H(E)$.
\item If $H(E)$ flat enough, then $f\equiv \sqrt{f}$ or $f\equiv {f}/2$.
\item Stop when $f\approx 10^{-8}$.
\end{itemize}

Note that choosing the probability as $1/g(E)$ in the second step implies that for higher configuration density at energy $E$, the choosing probability decreases. Therefore the method tends to go towards energies with few configurations. At this point the function has to be corrected by updating the value of $g$ and the energy $E$. Once a histogram has been obtained one can increase the precision by decreasing $f$, e.g. by dividing it by two. The ``flatness'' of the histogram can be measured as the ration of the minimum to the maximum value.

\subsection{Umbrella sampling}

This technique was developed and proposed in \citet{torrie}. The aim is to overcome the problem of the lack in ergodicity for certain energy landscapes. As an example, in the Ising model the system could have difficulties in jumping from a positive to a negative magnetization (or viceversa) if the system is very large. The basic idea is to multiply transition probabilities with a function that is large at the barrier and later remove this correction in the averaging step.
\begin{equation}
\tilde{p} \kl{C} = \frac{w\kl{C} e^{-\frac{E\kl{C}}{k_BT}}}{\sum_C{w\kl{C} e^{-\frac{E\kl{C}}{k_BT}}}}
\text{ \hspace{0.1cm} with \hspace{0.1cm} }
\avkl{A} = \frac{\avkl{A/w}_w}{\avkl{1/w}_w}.
\label{eq:torrie}
\end{equation}
