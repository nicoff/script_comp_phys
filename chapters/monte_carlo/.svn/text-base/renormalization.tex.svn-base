In this section, we won't be able to go very deeply into the theory of the subject due to its strong mathematical nature. We will therefore only skim through the main applications and present some numerical results.

We will make use of symmetries of the physical system to improve our simulations. Usually, the more information is available about a system, the better certain quantities can be evaluated. Close to the criticality, insights of the system can be used to better extrapolate the values to an infinite system. Close to the critical point, one of the most important properties of certain systems is the invariance under conformal transformations. This also implies the invariance under changes of scale (dilation invariance). Mind that this is only true at $T_c$. To increase mathematical precision one has to define exactly what it means to \emph{change scale}. For geometrical objects the meaning is somewhat intuitive. However, we are treating systems with different energy and spin configurations as well as different Hamiltonians. One possibility is to look at the free energy density, and its invariance. To renormalize a system means to change its scale by a factor $l$: $\tilde{L}= L/l$.  This can be done either in position, or in momentum (Fourier) space.

\subsection{Real Space Renormalization}

The easiest example for renormalization is the \emph{majority rule}. One considers local groups of spins, and instead of considering them all separately taking a sort of mean over that region: $\tilde{\sigma}_{\tilde{i}} =\text{sign}\kl{\sum_{\text{region}}\sigma_i}$. Attention must be paid on how the transformation is done. In a one dimensional lattice with up/down spins for example it would be a tragic error to apply this transformation on an even number of spins, since the sign is not well defined for all the possible situations.

\begin{minipage}{.48\textwidth}
 Another possible rule is \emph{decimation}. In decimation one just ignores spins with a certain pattern. Another example could be the density in fractal objects which does not change under scale transformations (remember the sand-box method in \citet{comp_phys}).

\end{minipage}
\end{minipage}

\vspace{0.1cm}

 Generally, there are two steps that one has to undertake:
\begin{itemize}
\item Decide which scale to change (e.g., the length of the system, the spins).
\item Evaluate the consequences for the system (e.g., for the Hamiltonian).
\end{itemize}
If the system is invariant under a certain transformation one should be able to iterate this transformation (almost) infinitely often. In other words, the critical point is a \emph{fixed point} for this transformation.


In order to put the concept of renormalization in a mathematical framework we can look at the free energy of a system, and require that it stays constant under scale transformations. Since the free energy is an extensive quantity, we have to renormalize the quantity itself to the system size.
\begin{equation}
\tilde{F}\kl{\tilde{\epsilon},\tilde{H}}=l^{-d} F\kl{\epsilon, H}\text{ with }\epsilon\equiv T-T_c.
\end{equation}
We then make use of scaling laws close to the critical point:
$$
F\kl{\epsilon,H} = l^d F\kl{l^{y_T}\epsilon, l^{y_H}H}
$$
$$
\Rightarrow 
\tilde{F}\kl{\tilde{\epsilon},\tilde{H}} = l^d F\kl{l^{y_T}\epsilon, l^{y_H}H}
$$
\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow 
\tilde{\epsilon} = l^{y_T}\epsilon\text{, }\tilde{H} = l^{y_H}H.
\end{equation}

Similarly, since renormalization will also affect the correlation length $\xi\propto \abs{T-T_c}^{-\nu}= \abs{\epsilon}^{-\nu}$ we can relate the critical exponent $\nu$ to $y_T$:
$$
\tilde{\epsilon}^{-\nu}\propto \tilde{\xi} = \frac{\xi}{l}
$$
$$
\Rightarrow
\tilde{\epsilon} =\frac{\epsilon}{l^{-\frac{1}{\nu}}} =l^{\frac{1}{\nu}}\epsilon=l^{y_T}\epsilon
$$
$$
\Rightarrow
y_T=\frac{1}{\nu}.
$$
Now it is clearer why the critical point is a fixed point of the transformation: at $T_c$, $\epsilon=0$, and whatever the value of the scaling factor, $\epsilon$ does not change.





\subsubsection*{Decimation of 1D Ising Model}
As an example, we will consider a one dimensional Ising chain, with spins that only interact with their nearest neighbors:

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}

 % \captionof{figure}{}
  \label{fig:1d_decimation}
\end{minipage}

\vspace{0.2cm}

To see explicitly what happens with the system, we calculate the partition function. The partition function is the sum over all the configurations $s_i$. We will split the partition function into two terms: one for the even sites and one for the odd sites. With $K=-\frac{J}{K_BT}$  and using

\begin{align*}
A &= \sum_{s_{2n+1}=\pm 1}{  e^  {K\kl   {  s_{2n}s_{2n+1}  + s_{2n+1} s_{2n+2}     }  } }\\
&=e^  {K\kl   {  s_{2n}+s_{2n+2}    }  }  + e^  {-K\kl   {  s_{2n}+s_{2n+2}    }  } \\
&=\text{cosh}\ekl{K\kl   {  s_{2n}+s_{2n+2}    } }
\end{align*}

we get
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{Z} &= \sum_{s_{2i}=\pm 1}{  \prod_{2i}{   \ekl{ {  
\sum_{s_{2i+1}=\pm 1}{  \prod_{2i+1}{e^  {K\kl   {  s_{2i}s_{2i+1}  + s_{2i+1} s_{2i+2}  }     }  } }  }} } }  \\
&=\sum_{s_{2i}=\pm 1}{  \prod_{2i}{  \mkl{2 \text{cosh}\ekl{K\kl{s_{2i}+s_{2i+2}}}} } }  \\
&=\sum_{s_{2i}=\pm 1}{  \prod_{2i}{  z\kl{K} e^{K' s_{2i}s_{2i+2} } } }  \\
&=\ekl{z\kl{K}}^{\frac{N}{2}}\sum_{s_{2i}=\pm 1}{  \prod_{2i}{   e^{K' s_{2i}s_{2i+2} } } }  
\end{align*}
There are only two possible states for the sites, and we can compute $z\kl{K}e^{K's_{2i}s_{2i+2}}= 2\text{cosh}\ekl{K\kl{ s_{2i}+s_{2i+2} }} $ explicitly:

\begin{equation}
z\kl{K}e^{K's_{2i}s_{2i+2}} =\begin{cases}
  2\text{cosh}\ekl{2K}  & \text{for }s_{2i}=s_{2i+2}\\
  2  & \text{for }s_{2i}=-s_{2i+2}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:condition_renorm}
\end{equation}
By dividing and multiplying the two cases we get
$$
e^{2K'} =  \text{cosh}\ekl{2K}  \text{ and } z^2\kl{K} =  4\text{cosh}\ekl{2K} 
$$
$$
\Rightarrow  K' =  \frac{1}{2}\text{ln}\kl{   \text{cosh}\ekl{2K}   }. 
$$
We have now obtained a rule after which the coupling constant $K$ (which contains the temperature and the spin coupling constant $J$) changes under scaling.In summary, we:
\begin{itemize}
\item chose the scaling rule (decimation).
\item imposed the Free energy to be constant
\item computed the consequences on the coupling constant $J$
\end{itemize}




\subsubsection*{Generalization}
In the above example it was possible to fulfill the condition of constant free energy with just one coupling constant. Luckily, the transformation rule for the coupling constant $K$ was enough to fulfill all the conditions expressed by eq. \eqref{eq:condition_renorm}. Generally this is not the case, and more coupling constants (e.g., next nearest neighbors) are needed. We therefore have to construct a renormalized Hamiltonian made up of renormalized coupling constants which generally contain more than one interaction:


\begin{equation}
\tilde{H} = \sum_{\alpha=1}^M{\tilde{K_{\alpha}} \tilde{O}_{\alpha}} 
\text{ with }
\tilde{O}_{\alpha} =  \sum_{i}{\prod_{k\in \epsilon_\alpha}{\tilde{\sigma}_{i+k}}} 
\end{equation}
and with the renormalization rules
$$
\tilde{K}_{\alpha}\kl{K_1,...,K_M},  \text{ with } \alpha \in \mkl{1,...,M}.
$$
Note that using $M$  instead of $\infty$ is a truncation, and in fact a systematic error. The accuracy of this approximation will also depend on the number of iterations that we want to take into account. At $T_c\neq 0$ we have a fixed point: $\tilde{K}_{\alpha}\kl{K_1^*,...,K_M^*}=K^*_\alpha$. A first ansatz to solve this problem is the linearization of the transformation. We can do this with a Jacobian $T_{\alpha,\beta} = \pder{\tilde{K}_\alpha}{K_\beta}$:

\begin{equation}
 \tilde{K}_\alpha - K_\alpha^* = \sum_\beta { \left .T_{\alpha, \beta}\right|_{K^*}\kl{K_\beta - K_\beta^*}}
 \label{eq:lin_trafo}
\end{equation}


\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}{.48\textwidth}
 We can now construct a flow chart of the coupling constant and obtain values for $\tilde{K}$ for each vector $K=\kl{K_1,...,K_M}$. At $T_c$ (where $K=K^*$), we will have a fix point. Fig. \ref{fig:renorm_flow} shows a flow diagram of a renormalization group transformation. It can already be seen that the flow is stable in some directions (the ones in which the system tends to the fixed point) and unstable in others (the ones that lead the system to go away from the fixed point).

  \label{fig:renorm_flow}
\end{minipage}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{0.2cm}
To analyze the behavior of the system close to criticality, we will consider the eigenvalues $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_M$ and the eigenvectors $\phi_1,...,\phi_M$ of the linearized transformation \ref{eq:lin_trafo}. From linear algebra we know that $\tilde{\phi_\alpha}=\lambda_\alpha\phi_\alpha$. Clearly, if $\lambda_\alpha>1$ we have an unstable situation (the scaling field increases at every iteration of the transformation). The biggest eigenvalue will be the dominating one (which is the temperature exponent in the Ising model). We can identify the scaling field $\tilde{\epsilon}=l^{y_T}\epsilon$ with the eigenvector of the transformation, and the scaling factor with eigenvalue $\lambda_T = l^{y_T}$,

$$
\Rightarrow \nu = \frac{1}{y_T}=\frac{\text{ln}\ekl{l}}{\text{ln}\ekl{\lambda_T}}.
$$
This means that we can now calculate critical exponents using the scaling behavior of the system, if the scaling factor $l$ is known. 
\subsection{Monte Carlo Renormalization Group}

The implementation of real space renormalization with Monte Carlo techniques was first proposed by  \citet{ma_renorm} and then reformulated by \citet{swendsen_renorm}. Since we are dealing with generalized Hamiltonians with a lot of interaction terms, we will calculate the thermal average using the operators $O_\alpha$.

\begin{equation}
\avkl{O_{\alpha}} =
\frac    {\sum_\alpha {O_\alpha e^{\sum_\beta {K_\beta O_\beta}} }  }   {\sum_\alpha {e^{\sum_\beta {K_\beta O_\beta}}}  } =
\pder {F}{K_\alpha}
\label{eq:op_av}
\end{equation}
where $F=\text{ln}\ekl{Z}$ is the free energy. Using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem one can also numerically calculate the response functions:
\begin{align*}
\chi_{\alpha,\beta} &\equiv \pder{\avkl{O_\alpha}}{K_\beta} = \avkl{O_\alpha O_\beta} -\avkl{O_\alpha }\avkl{ O_\beta}\\
\tilde{\chi}_{\alpha,\beta} &\equiv \pder{\avkl{\tilde{O}_\alpha}}{K_\beta} = \avkl{\tilde{O}_\alpha O_\beta} -\avkl{\tilde{O}_\alpha }\avkl{ O_\beta}
\end{align*}
Using the chain rule,  one can calculate with equation \eqref{eq:op_av} that



$$
\tilde{\chi}_{\alpha,\beta} \equiv \pder{\avkl{\tilde{O}_\alpha}}{K_\beta} =
\sum_\gamma {     \pder{\tilde{K}_\gamma}{K_\beta}    \pder{\avkl{\tilde{O}_\alpha^{\kl{n}}}}{K_\gamma}    }  =
\sum_\gamma  {   T_{\gamma, \beta}  \chi_{\alpha,\gamma}^{\kl{n+1}}  }.
$$
We can obtain $T_{\gamma, \beta}$ from the correlation functions by solving a set of M coupled linear equations as we did in the previous section for the Jacobi function of the renormalization transformation. We can iterate this method, in order to get systematically better values, if we are at the point $K=K^*$.

\subsubsection*{Errors in MCRG}

There are many error sources in this technique, that originate from the fact that we are using a combination of several tricks to calculate our results, of which one should be aware of:

\begin{itemize}
\item Statistical errors
\item Truncation of the Hamiltonian to the M$^{th}$ order.
\item Finite number of scaling iterations
\item Finite Size effects
\item No analytical knowledge of $K^*$
\end{itemize}
