\addchap{Preface}

This is only a draft of what at the end of the semester will hopefully be the script of the lecture \emph{Computational Statistical Physics}. The following version only includes the first two chapters treated in the lecture. It will be updated irregularly throughout the rest of the semester by the end of every chapter treated during the lectures. The script has not been proofreaded by the professor, so do not expect flawless writing or completely correct equations. In case you should notice any mistake, typos, or in the case you would like some extra information, explanation, reference or whatsoever, please notify us (noffeddu@student.ethz.ch or nico.offeddu@gmail.com). We will be happy to integrate/modify/expand the script, and your fellow students will surely be more than grateful for that.
