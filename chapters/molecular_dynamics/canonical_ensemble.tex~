Often we are not interested in single particles, but rather on macroscopic quantities. As example is the simulation of some cooling device for a building or the heating and the drag on the surfaces in some fluid (e.g. planes, car profiles, ...). In all these cases one is interested in local quantities such as temperature, pressure chemical composition, densiti etc. In such situations only macroscopic effects are important, and to simulate them there are some techniques strongly related to MS that can be used. We will present some of them in this section.

Typically, experiments are conducted at constant temperature (e.g. room temperature) and not at constant energy. This is a common situation, since systems are usually able to exchange energy with the outer world. We will therefore couple our system to a heat bath to realize this situation. There are various option to do this:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rescaling of velocities
\item Introduce constraints (Hoover)
\item Thermostat (Nos\'e-Hoover)
\item Stochastic method (Anderson)
\end{itemize}




Before starting with the discussion of the methods, we should know precisely what is meant when we speak about temperature. For a theoretical ansatz, we can start with the equipartition theorem
\begin{equation}
\avkl{p_i^{\kl{\alpha}} \pder{\mathcal{H}}{p_i^{\kl{\alpha}}}} = \avkl{q_i^{\kl{\alpha}} \pder{\mathcal{H}}{q_i^{\kl{\alpha}}}} = kT
\label{eq:equipartition}
\end{equation}


and the classical Hamiltonian that describes the energy of the system:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}=
\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\frac{\vec{p}^2_i}{2m_i}+\mathcal{V}\kl{\vec{x}_1,...,\vec{x}_N}}
\label{eq:hamilton3}
\end{equation}

Combining \eqref{eq:equipartition} and \eqref{eq:hamilton3} one gets

\begin{equation}
3 kT = \avkl{\vec{p}_i \pder{\mathcal{H}}{\vec{p}_i}} =
\sum_{\alpha}{p_i^{\kl{\alpha}}\frac{\vec{p}^2_i}{2m_i}} = 
2 \frac{1}{2 m_i} \avkl{\vec{p}^2_i} = 2 E_{kin,i}
\end{equation}


and we define  the instantaneous temperature $\mathcal{T}$ as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{T}\equiv \frac{2}{k\kl{3N-3}} \sum_{i=1}^N {\frac{\vec{p}_i^2}{2m_i}}.
\end{equation}



\section{Velocity rescaling}


Let us now simulate a given fixed temperature $T$. In classical mechanics, we know that temperatures corresponds to a certain kinetic energy, so we should be able to control the Temperature by changing the velocities of the particles. If the system rolls away from the desired temperature we simply rescale the velocities by a factor $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
\vec{v}_i \rightarrow \alpha \vec{v}_i.
\end{equation}
The measured temperature scales proportionally to the squared velocities, thus 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{T} \rightarrow \alpha^2 \mathcal{T},
\end{equation}
which means that to stay at the desired Temperature $T$ we must use
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{T}{ \mathcal{T}}}
\end{equation}
This method might seem very effective, but the price that one pays for this alteration is that the physics of the system is not respected and there are serious consequences like the velocity distribution that does not recover the expected canonical velocity distribution after Boltzmann. This problem can be softened by some relaxation time 
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \sqrt{1 + \frac{\Delta t}{t_T}\kl{\frac{T}{\mathcal{T}}-1}}
\label{eq:relaxation}
\end{equation} 
but this does not solve the problem. In fact, this method can be used safely only to initialize a configuration at a given temperature, but it should not be used to simulate a heath bath.

\section{Constraint method}

A more subtle way of influencing the system is adding a friction term to the classical equation of motion:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\vec{p}} = f_i - \xi \vec{p}_i, 
\label{eq:fric_term}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{p}_i = m_i \dot{\vec{x}}_i$. In Hoover's original proposal the condition for constant temperature was enforced via Lagrange multipliers: the condition of constant temperature
\begin{equation*}
0=\dot{\mathcal{T}} \propto \dder{\sum_{i=1}^N {\vec{p}_i^2}}{t} \propto \sum_{i=1}^N {\dot{\vec{p}}_i\vec{p}_i} =  \sum_{i=1}^N { \kl{f_i-\xi\vec{p}_i}  \vec{p}_i} 
\end{equation*}
implies for the Lagrange multiplier $\xi$:
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac  {  \sum_{i=1}^N {f_i\vec{p}_i}   }  {   \sum_{i=1}^N { \abs{\vec{p}_i}^2  }    } 
\end{equation}






Berendsen proposed


\begin{equation}
\xi = \gamma \kl{1-\frac{T}{\mathcal{T}}}
\end{equation}

which can be seen as a Taylor expansion of \eqref{eq:relaxation}, for small $\Delta t$ and $\mathcal{T}-T$ giving
\begin{equation*}
\xi = \frac{1}{2t_T\mathcal{T}} \kl{\mathcal{T}-T} \Rightarrow \gamma \approx \frac{1}{2t_T}.
\end{equation*}
As the velocity rescaling method, this method conserves temperature but it does not recover the right velocity distribution. \eqref{eq:fric_term} is also a modification of the physics of the system, and one should not expect results that are realistic in all their aspects.





\section{Nos\`e-Hoover thermostat}

This method is the only one that actually respects the physics of a system connected to a heath bath. Suichi Nos\'e introduced a new degree of freedom $s$ that describes the heath bath (\citet{nose} and \citet{nose2}). It is connected to a potential energy
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{V}\kl{s} = \kl{3N+1}kT\ln{s}
\end{equation}
and  a kinetic energy
\begin{equation}
K\kl{s} = \frac{1}{2} Q \dot{s}^2
\end{equation}
Now one can work with the conservation of the energy of the whole system (particles and heat bath) allowing energy to be exchanged between the bath and the particles to mantain the temperature constant. Until now, we always used an explicit integration method for solving the equations. We did this with a fixed time step $\Delta t$. The new degree of freedom acts on the time step and rescales it:

\begin{equation}
\text{dt}'=s\text{dt}
\end{equation}

With this the whole Hamiltonian changes. It is easy to imagine that if one alters the time steps, the velocities change:

\begin{equation*}
\vec{v}_i' = \frac{\text{d}\vec{x}_i}{\text{dt'}} = \frac{\text{d}\vec{x}_i}{\text{dt}} \frac{\text{dt}}{\text{dt'}} = \frac{\vec{v}_i}{s},
\end{equation*}

thus the energy is also changed. A new Hamiltonian is needed after the time is rescaled:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} = \sum^N_{i=1}{ \frac{\vec{p}^{\,\prime 2}_i}{2m_is^2} } + \frac{1}{2}Q \dot{s}^2 + \mathcal{V}\kl{\vec{x}_1,...,\vec{x}_N} + \mathcal{V}\kl{s}.
\end{equation}
The scaling of time affects all the properties of the system, included the momenta of the particles. Once the Hamiltonian is known, we can calculate all the interesting values of the system:

\begin{itemize} 
\item momentum and force: $$\vec{p}_i^{\,\prime}= m_is^2\dot{\vec{x}}_i$$ $$\frac{\text{d}\vec{p}_i^{\,\prime}}{\text{dt}'} = 2m_i s \dot{s}\dot{\vec{x}}_i + m_is^2\ddot{\vec{x}}_i$$
\item velocities:  $$\frac{\text{d}\vec{x}_i}{\text{dt}'} = \pder{\mathcal{H}}{\vec{p}_i^{\,\prime}}=\frac{\vec{p}_i^{\,\prime}}{m_i s^2}$$   $$ \frac{\text{d}s}{\text{dt}'} = \pder{\mathcal{H}}{\vec{p}_s}=\frac{p_s}{\mathcal{Q}}   $$
\item forces:  $$\frac{\text{d}\vec{p}_i^{\,\prime}}{\text{dt}'} =-\pder{\mathcal{H}}{\vec{x}_i'}=-\nabla_{\vec{x}_i}\mathcal{V}\kl{\vec{x}_1,...,\vec{x}_N} = \vec{f}_i$$   $$\frac{\text{d}\vec{p}_s}{\text{dt}'} =-\pder{\mathcal{H}}{s} = \frac{1}{s}\kl{    \sum^N_{i=1}{ \frac{\vec{p}_i^{\,\prime 2}}{2m_is^2} }  -  \kl{3N+1}kT   } $$   
\end{itemize}


From the Hamiltonian one can easily get the  equation of motion of the particles and the heat bath using the Euler-Lagrange equations:

\begin{equation}
m_is^2 \ddot{\vec{x}}_i = \vec{f}_i - 2 m_i \dot{s} s \dot{\vec{x}}_i \hspace{.5cm} \text{with } i\in\mkl{1,...,N}
\label{eq:nos_motion1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Q \ddot{\vec{s}} = \sum^N_{i=1}{ m_is\dot{\vec{x}}_i^2 }  -  \frac{1}{s}\kl{3N+1}kT   
\label{eq:nos_motion2}
\end{equation}

In this case the system conserves energy, and the velocities are distributed as expected. Note that the equations \eqref{eq:nos_motion1} and \eqref{eq:nos_motion2} are coupled. This reflects the fact that the two systems are not isolated and can exchange energy in form of temperature. Of course one is also interested in the real time equations. For this one has to substitute the virtual time into the real time: $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t}{s}$:

\begin{itemize}
\item velocities:  $$\frac{\text{d}\vec{x}_i}{\text{dt}} = s \frac{\text{d}\vec{x}_i}{\text{dt}x} =\frac{\vec{p}_i^{\,\prime}}{m_is} = \frac{\vec{p}_i^{\,\prime}}{m_i}  $$  $$\frac{\text{d}s}{\text{dt}} = s \frac{\text{d}s}{\text{dt}'} =s \frac{\vec{p}_s}{Q}  $$
\item forces:  $$\frac{\text{d}\vec{p}_i}{\text{dt}} =s \frac{\text{d}}{\text{dt}'}\kl{\frac{\vec{p}_i'}{s}} = \frac{\text{d}\vec{p}_i^{\,\prime}}{\text{dt}'} - \frac{1}{s} \frac{\text{d}s}{\text{dt}'}\vec{p}_i^{\,\prime}   =  \vec{f}_i -  \frac{1}{s} \frac{\text{d}s}{\text{dt}}\vec{p}_i$$   $$\frac{\text{d}\vec{p}_s}{\text{dt}} =s \frac{\text{d}p_s}{\text{dt}'} =\sum^N_{i=1}{\frac{\vec{p}_i^{\,2}}{m_i}} - \kl{3N+1}kT $$
\end{itemize}

The equations \eqref{eq:nos_motion1} and \eqref{eq:nos_motion1} can also be expressed in the form of the eqauations o a system with viscous friction. Defining $\xi\equiv \der{ln\kl{s}}{t} = \frac{\dot{s}}{s}$, yields


\begin{equation}
\ddot{\vec{x}}_i =\frac{ \vec{f}_i }{m_i} - \xi \dot{\vec{x}}_i
\label{eq:nos_motion3}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}Q \dot{\xi} =\underbrace{ \frac{1}{2} \sum^N_{i=1}{ m_i\dot{\vec{x}}_i^2 }}_{\text{actual kinetic energy}}  -  \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\kl{3N+1}kT }_{\text{desired kinetic energy}}  
\label{eq:nos_motion4}
\end{equation}

The meaning of $Q$ is clearer in this form: it represents the strength of the coupling to the heath bath. The higher $Q$, the stronger the system reacts to temperature fluctuations. The problem of very wrong values of $Q$ are an oscillatory behavior of the system (small $Q$) or too slow equilibration of the system ($Q$ to large). The optimal value of $Q$ should recover the natural temperature fluctuations:

\begin{equation}
\bar{\Delta T} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{N d}} \bar{T},
\end{equation}
where d is the dimension and $N$ the particle number of the system, see Fig. \ref{fig:temp_osc2}.

\end{center}




\section{Stochastic method}

This method, proposed by Andersen \citep{andersen_thermostat}, is a combination of the velocity rescaling and Monte Carlo. At temperature $T$, one expects the velocity distribution to recover the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:

\begin{equation}
P\kl{\vec{p}} = \frac{1}{\kl{\pi k T}^\frac{3}{2}} exp\ekl{ - \frac{\kl{\vec{p}-\vec{p}_0}^2}{kT}  }.
\label{eq:bltz_vert}
\end{equation}

Regularly, every $n$ time steps, the simulation will be suspended and particles are selected randomly and given a new velocity according to \eqref{eq:bltz_vert}. If this is done very often, this method converges towards pure Monte Carlo, if this happens very rarely, the method converges towards classical molecular dynamics. In this hybrid method $n$ becomes an adjustable artificial parameter  that couples the heat bath to the system. The smaller $n$, the larger the coupling to the heat bath is. If the parameter is too large, the system is microcanonical. In a proper simulation, the value of $n$ must be related to the system, e.g. to the number of particles.

\section{Constant Pressure}

The other classical situation is the one in which the pressure is held constant. For this we will again make use of generalized partition theorem \eqref{eq:equipartition} with the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{H} = K\kl{\vec{p}} + V\kl{\vec{x}}
\end{equation*}
Taking the derivative of the hamiltonian with respect to the spatial component yields
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{3}\avkl{    \sum^N_{i=1}\vec{x}_i \cdot \kl{ \nabla_{\vec{x}_i} V\kl{\vec{x}}   }    } = NkT.
\end{equation*}
This quantity has the dimension of energy, the prefactor comes from the dimension of the system. If we separate the forces between particles and the forces applied aganst the volume surface:
\begin{align*}
&=-\frac{1}{3}\avkl{    \sum^N_{i=1}\vec{x}_i \cdot \kl{ \vec{f}_i^{\text{ext}} + \vec{f}_i^{\text{part}}   }    } \\
&=-\frac{1}{3}\avkl{\sum^N_{i=1}\vec{x}_i \cdot \kl{ \vec{f}_i^{\text{ext}}   }    } 
\underbrace{-\frac{1}{3}\avkl{\sum^N_{i=1}\vec{x}_i \cdot \kl{  \vec{f}_i^{\text{part}}   }    } }_{\equiv\text{virial}}.
\end{align*}

The \emph{virial} represents the force that one must apply to keep the system at a certain volume, i.e. the pressure.

\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{3}\avkl{\sum^N_{i=1}\vec{x}_i \cdot \kl{  \vec{f}_i^{\text{part}}   }    } 
=
-\frac{1}{3} \int_\Gamma p\vec{x} \text{d}\vec{A}
=
-\frac{1}{3} p \int_V \kl{\nabla\cdot\vec{x}} \text{d}\vec{V} 
=
-pV
\end{equation*}

We can thus define the instantaneous pressure as

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}  \equiv NkT + \avkl{w}
\label{eq:inst_press}
\end{equation}


For the implementation of a simulation by constant pressure we can use the same method as for the Hoover thermostat. We will introduce a sort of ``pressure bath''. One can imagine this as a piston that changes the volume of the system. Our degree of freedom now is not a scaling of time, but a change in volume, hence length. As in the Hoover thermostat, we can introduce an artificial parameter 
$W$, that describes how strong the system is coupled to the pressure bath. A useful image is that $W$ corresponds to the weight of the piston: the heavier the piston, the mor difficult for the system is to leave a given temperature.

For the volume change we will use 
\begin{equation}
V = 1- \alpha_T \frac{\Delta}{t_p}\kl{p-\mathcal{P}}
\end{equation} 
where $\alpha_T$ is the isothermal compressibility and $t_p$ is a relaxation time for the pressure. This gives us the factor by which we have to rescale the lentghs $\vec{x}\rightarrow V^\frac{1}{3}\vec{x}$. This is only true in isotropic systems, where a change in length is the same in every directions. In this case, we can just take this length rescaling and change all the derivatives as before. We can use the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{2} m_i \dot{\vec{x}}_i^2  + \frac{1}{2} W\dot{V}^2 + V\kl{ \vec{x}_1,...,\vec{x}_N  } + pV
\end{equation} 
where the new variable V is a volume change controlled by a piston of mass W, that also defines the canonical momentum 
\begin{equation}
p_V= W\dot{V}
\end{equation} 

From here one can derive all the equations of motion from the Hamiltonian. The difference from the Hoover thermostat is that not the velocities and the kinetic energy changes, but the potential are affected by the spatial rescaling:

$$
\der{\vec{x}_i}{t} = \pder{\mathcal{H}}{\vec{p}_i} = \frac{\vec{p}_i}{m_i V^{\frac{1}{3}}}
$$
$$
\der{V}{t} = \pder{\mathcal{H}}{p_V} = \frac{p_V}{W}
$$
$$
\der{\vec{p}_i}{t} = - \pder{\mathcal{H}}{\vec{x}_i} = -\nabla_{\vec{x}_i} \mathcal{V}\kl{V^{\frac{1}{3}}\vec{x}_i}= \vec{f}_i
$$


$$
\der{p_V}{t} = - \pder{\mathcal{H}}{V} = -\frac{1}{3V}\sum_{i=1}^N\kl{\vec{x}_i\cdot\nabla_{\vec{x}_i} \mathcal{V}\kl{V^{\frac{1}{3}}\vec{x}_i}} -p
$$

In the Berendsen barostat the equations of motion boil down to



\begin{equation}
\ddot{\vec{x}}_i = \frac{\vec{f}_i}{m_i} - \frac{\dot{V}}{3V}\vec{x}_i
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
W\ddot{V} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{3V} \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \dot{\vec{x}}_i^2 + \frac{1}{3V} \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{f}_i\vec{x}_i}_{\text{instantaneous pressure }\mathcal{P}} \, - \,p
\end{equation} 



\section{Parrinello-Rahman Barostat}

The problem with this method is that we assumed isotropic space, with an isotropic gas of molecules. This is not the case in general. In the case of solids (e.g. crystals), the volume cannot be rescaled equally in every direction, since the reaction to pressure and pressure changes can be different along different directions. The first and simplest generalization is an orthogonal scaling of a box described by three vectors, $\vec{a}, \vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ of a volume


\begin{equation}
V= \vec{a}\cdot \kl{\vec{b}\times\vec{c}} = \text{det}\kl{\mat{H}}\hspace{0.4cm}\text{with }\mat{H} = \mkl{\vec{a},\vec{b},\vec{c}}.
\end{equation}


The position of a particle $i$ in the box can then be described by
\begin{equation}
\vec{r}_i = \mat{H} \vec{s}_i = x_i \vec{a} + y_i \vec{b} + z_i \vec{c} \hspace{0.4cm}\text{with }0<x_i,y_i,z_i<1
\end{equation}
and from this definition follows the distance between to particles $i$ and $j$:


\begin{equation}
\vec{r}_{i,j}^{\,2} =\vec{s}_{i,j}^{\,T} \mat{G} \vec{s}_{i,j}  \hspace{0.4cm}\text{with }\mat{G} = \mat{H}^{\,T} \mat{H}
\end{equation}

The Hamiltonian can be then expressed using this new distances:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i m_i\dot{\vec{s}}_{i}^{\,T} \mat{G} \dot{\vec{s}}_{i} +  \sum_{i,j} \mathcal{V}\kl{\vec{r}_{i,j}} + \frac{1}{2} W \text{Tr}\kl { \dot{ \mat{H}} ^{\,T} \dot{\mat{H}}  } + pV
\end{equation}

Again, from the Hamiltonian one can derive the equations of motion in the usual way and the result,

\begin{equation}
m_i\ddot{\vec{s}}_i = \mat{H}^{-1} \vec{f}_i - m_i \mat{G}^{-1}\kl{\dot{\mat{G}}\dot{\vec{s}}_i}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
W\ddot{\mat{H}} = \mat{p} V \kl{\mat{H}^{-1}}^T
\end{equation}
is very important when simulating crystals, e.g. in solid state physics or in material science. Our degree of freedom now is not a simple parameter like in the Hoover thermostat, but its a tensor ($\mat{H}$) given by the geometry of the system. In the case pressure and temperature constant at the same time, one can use a combination of the two, the $NpT$ ensemble (also known as isothermal-isobaric ensemble).
