\addchap{Preface}







This is the first part of a provvisory draft of the script. The rest of the script will follow during the semester. Since the course covered a rather broad spectrum of topics, time ofted did not allow to treat them deeply. This is also why, as you will notice while reading, special attention has been paid in giving some references along the text. If during your (fruitful) learning, you should notice any mistake, typoes, or in the case you would like some extra information, explanation, reference or whatsoever about the methods, the scientists or the sources, please notify us (nico.offeddu@gmail.com). We would be really happy to receive feedback and to integrate/modify/expand the script. You can be sure that your fellow (and onfollowing generations of) students will be more than grateful for that.
