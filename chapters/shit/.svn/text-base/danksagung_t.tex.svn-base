I'd like to take the opportunity to thank some friends for the help. In alphabetical order:

In everyday life:
\small
\vspace{8pt}

\noindent
\emph{Ms. Castanio} who sustained me, no matter what kind of aliens dwelled her. And yes, for everyone else life is easier. Maybe because you cheer us all up.
\vspace{5pt}

\noindent
\emph{Ezo} and all the d\"oner places in Freiburg. They are the reason I survived these years.
\vspace{5pt}

\noindent
\emph{Fabse}, who tolerates my horrible character. Smiling no matter what, when or why something happens with tony, tschärner, fridolin  and other strange figures inhabiting our pink-eschholz-house, appreciating my cooking and never leaving something uneaten.
\vspace{5pt}

\noindent
\emph{Julian Von Kr\"oger} and \emph{Capt'n Roth} for showing me the two furthest sides of Germany.

\noindent
Kollnau and Waldkirch.
\vspace{5pt}

\noindent
\emph{Luisa} and \emph{Vittoria}, whom I would like to see more often.
\vspace{6pt}

\noindent
\emph{Monica} who made me be here now.
\vspace{5pt}

\noindent
\emph{Muajero Rahibe} and \emph{Binit Hellue}, my beloved sons,  who shared my passion for kus-kus. We will ride on camels to Aqaba to have a coffee with Lawrence. Without your robot, erasers, lollies and help, it would have been even more boring.

At the institute:
\small
\vspace{8pt}

\emph{Oscar Von der L\"uhe} who gave me the possibility to work at the KIS.
\vspace{5pt}

\emph{Markus Roth} who introduced me to Helio- and Asteroseismology and helped me during this months.
\vspace{5pt}

\noindent
\emph{Daniel Siegel} who wrote an inspiring Work.
\vspace{5pt}

\noindent
All the colleagues of House 2 who namm-nammed with me almost every day. Particularly \emph{René} who keeps up with all the versions of \emph{eva2} and gave a sense for her existence. \emph{Hans-Peter}, \emph{Kolja}, \emph{Moritz}, \emph{Vincent} and \emph{Wiebke},  whose help was precious and by no means foregone.

\noindent
The pleasant company of all the people at KIS makes it a wonderful place to work in.

\emph{P.D.} and \emph{Laus}. At the end, so that they'll learn that they are rank and sticky. In footnotesize-font, in the hope that noone will notice because I can only be ashamed of them. Next time they won't be acknowledged because they're not worth of mention. Any other statement would have not been believed, and shall they never come up to the idea that they helped in something.
