\addchap{Preface}







This is the script of the lecture \emph{Computational Statistical Physics} held at ETHZ during the spring semester 2014 by Prof. H.J. Herrmann. The script has not been proofreaded by the professor yet, so do not expect flawless writing. Since the course covered a rather broad spectrum of topics, time ofted did not allow us to treat them deeply. This is also why, as you will hopefully notice while reading, special attention has been paid in giving some reference along the text. If during your (fruitful) summer learning, you should notice any mistake, typoes, or in the case you would like some extra information, explanation, reference or whatsoever about the methods, the scientists or the sources, please notify me (nico.offeddu@gmail.com). I would be really happy to receive feedback and to integrate/modify/expand the script. You can be sure that your fellow (and onfollowing generations of) students will be more than grateful for that.
